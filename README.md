Hi, I'm Samuel Owusu Nii ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:
I'm a dedicated **Web Developer** and **Software Engineer** focused on backend data integration, programming languages, API development, and creating web applications.

I have a **BSc in Computer Engineering** from the **University of Ghana** and am currently working towards a **Graduate Diploma in Web Development**.

I am skilled in **frontend development**, where I create easy-to-use and visually attractive user interfaces using **HTML**, **CSS**, and JavaScript frameworks like **React.js**.

For **backend development**, I work with technologies like **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Django Rest Framework** to build strong server-side solutions. I focus on making sure data is processed quickly and accurately. I have achieved things like a **data retrieval speed of under 100 milliseconds** and a **data accuracy rate of 95%**.

I also specialize in building **RESTful APIs** to allow smooth communication between frontend and backend systems. Iâ€™ve made sure these APIs have great performance, with an **API response time of less than 50 milliseconds** and **99% uptime**.

I am proficient in **Python** and passionate about learning new technologies. I always aim for excellence in **web development** and **software engineering**. Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can work together!
